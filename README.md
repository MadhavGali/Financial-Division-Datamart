# Financial Division Datamart for The Product Company
The Product Company is a distributor of products to many industries. The company acquired two other companies which operates in different regions.The three companies even after the merger have their own information systems. Having three financial systems is making the analytics team difficult to process the data and analyze it. So, I created a data warehouse which handles all the financial information needed to make decisions.
